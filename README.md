## Features

The employee is provided with a single-page daily planner with the correct day auto-generated at the top of the page.

The daily planner has timeblocks for standard business hours, in one-hour increments. 

During business hours, each time block is a different color, which indicates whether the timeblock is in the past, present, or future.

When the employee clicks into the timeblock, it changes to a different color to indicate that it can accept entry of text.

When the employee clicks the blue save button that corresponds to the timeblock, the text entered is saved in local storage.

The saved text persists even when the user refreshes the page, due to the local storage.
